#.3.1.Write a function called linear_search_product that takes the list of products and a target product name as input. The function should perform a linear search to find the target product in the list and return a list of indices of all occurrences of the product if found, or an empty list if the product is not found.
def linear_search_product(product_list, target_product):
    indices = []
    for index, product in enumerate(product_list):
        if product == target_product:
            indices.append(index)
    return indices

# Example usage:
products = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "grape", "apple"]
target = "apple"
result = linear_search_product(products, target)
if result:
    print(f"{target} found at indices: {result}")
else:
    print(f"{target} not found in the list.")
